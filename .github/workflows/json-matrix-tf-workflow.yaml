#   - Now you can include completely new combinations and even specify all of your matrix legs with include.
#   - The Actions expression language has a fromJSON(value) method that can take a stingified JSON object and bind it to a property.
#   - Combining this with run-matrix.outputs you can build a workflow that has a fully dynamic matrix.
